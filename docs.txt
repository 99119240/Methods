Yes, the provided code includes the necessary steps to download an encrypted DLL, decrypt it, load it into memory, and then inject it into a target process. The main components for achieving this are:

Download Encrypted DLL:

DownloadFile function is used to download the encrypted DLL from a specified URL.
Decrypt DLL:

Decrypt function decrypts the downloaded encrypted DLL using a provided key and initialization vector.
Load DLL into Memory:

LoadDllIntoMemory function allocates memory in the current process using VirtualAllocEx and writes the decrypted DLL into that allocated memory using WriteProcessMemory.
Wait for Target Process:

WaitForTargetProcess waits until the target process is running.
Inject DLL into Target Process:

InjectDllIntoProcess function opens the target process, gets the address of LoadLibraryA in the kernel32.dll, creates a remote thread to call LoadLibraryA with the DLL's memory address.
Note: The code for loading the DLL into the memory (LoadDllIntoMemory) is a placeholder, and you may need to implement a more comprehensive mechanism based on your specific use case.

Ensure that you replace the placeholders like "YourEncryptionKey", "https://example.com/your_encrypted_dll.dll", and "TargetProcess.exe" with your actual encryption key, DLL URL, and target process name, respectively.
